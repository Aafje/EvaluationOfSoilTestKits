# EvaluationOfSoilTestKits
Raw data of my bachelor thesis project (2021) on the evaluation of soil test kits and the assessment based on accuracy, ease-of-use, cost and time. 


Files: Phosphate_Comparison_Rapi, Phosphate_Comparison_LL, Phosphate_Comparison_Mil --> 
Contain the organized test kit results for phosphate and lab results for phosphate on an ordinal scale.
These files were used for statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to compare test-kit results to lab results to assess phosphate measuring accuracy of test kits.
