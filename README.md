# EvaluationOfSoilTestKits
Raw data of my bachelor thesis project (2021) on the evaluation of soil test kits and the assessment based on accuracy, ease-of-use, cost and time. 

Files: Nitrate_Comparison_Rapi, Nitrate_Comparison_LL, Nitrate_Comparison_Mil --> 
Contain the organized test kit results for nitrate and lab results for nitrate on an ordinal scale.
These files were used for statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to compare test-kit results to lab results to assess nitrate measuring accuracy of test kits.
