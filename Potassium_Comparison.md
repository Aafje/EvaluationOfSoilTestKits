# EvaluationOfSoilTestKits
Raw data of my bachelor thesis project (2021) on the evaluation of soil test kits and the assessment based on accuracy, ease-of-use, cost and time. 


Files: Potassium_Comparison_Rapi, Potassium_Comparison_LL, Potassium_Comparison_Mil --> 
Contain the organized test kit results for potassium and lab results for potassium on an ordinal scale.
These files were used for statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to compare test-kit results to lab results to assess potassium measuring accuracy of test kits.
